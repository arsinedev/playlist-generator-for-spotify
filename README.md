# Playlist Generator for Spotify

## Demo

In the demo below, a Spotify playlist with 2500+ songs is shared to the app, and based on the user input, the first 35 songs are shuffled and saved in a separate playlist. After saving to the playlist, the user is redirected to the playlist in the Spotify app.

The goal is to listen to only the first 35 songs _on shuffle_.
